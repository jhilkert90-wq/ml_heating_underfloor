# Shadow Mode User Guide

## Quick Start

Shadow mode enables ML heating to learn your building's physics without disrupting your current heating system. The heat curve continues controlling your heating while ML learns in the background and provides efficiency insights.

### Enable Shadow Mode

1. **Set configuration**:
   ```yaml
   # In config.yaml
   SHADOW_MODE: true
   ```

2. **Restart ML Heating service**:
   ```bash
   docker restart ml_heating
   ```

3. **Monitor learning progress** via dashboard or Home Assistant sensors

### Parallel Deployment Identity

When `SHADOW_MODE=true`, ML Heating publishes its own outputs into a separate
namespace so the live installation stays untouched:

- Home Assistant output entities automatically gain a `_shadow` suffix.
- `INFLUX_FEATURES_BUCKET` is written as `<bucket>_shadow`.
- `UNIFIED_STATE_FILE` is isolated automatically as `..._shadow.json`.

Examples:

- `sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur` -> `sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur_shadow`
- `sensor.ml_model_mae` -> `sensor.ml_model_mae_shadow`
- `ml_heating_features` -> `ml_heating_features_shadow`

The system still learns from the live heat-curve output via
`ACTUAL_TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID` and the normal historical `INFLUX_BUCKET`.

## Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist when bringing up a parallel shadow deployment:

1. Set `SHADOW_MODE=true`.
2. Keep `ACTUAL_TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID` pointed at the live controller output so learning still follows the real heat curve. If your live controller writes `sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur`, then keep `ACTUAL_TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur`.
3. Restart the service and confirm the app starts without falling back to legacy errors.
4. Verify Home Assistant creates suffixed output entities such as `sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur_shadow`, `sensor.ml_heating_learning_shadow`, and `sensor.ml_model_mae_shadow`. With `TARGET_OUTLET_TEMP_ENTITY_ID=sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur`, the shadow deployment publishes to `sensor.ml_vorlauftemperatur_shadow`.
5. Verify generated ML measurements arrive in `<INFLUX_FEATURES_BUCKET>_shadow`, for example `ml_heating_features_shadow`.
6. Verify the isolated unified state file exists, for example `unified_thermal_state_shadow.json`.
7. Leave `ML_HEATING_CONTROL_ENTITY_ID=on` if you want the dedicated shadow deployment to keep publishing its `_shadow` outputs. Turning that helper off switches to runtime shadow behavior, but it does not create a new namespace by itself.

```

## Understanding the Metrics

### Learning Confidence (0-10 scale)
- **0-3**: Initial learning phase
- **3-5**: Basic competency achieved  
- **5-7**: Good accuracy, consider active mode
- **7-10**: High confidence, ready for active mode

### Efficiency Advantage (Temperature difference)
- **Positive (+2°C)**: ML more efficient, predicts lower outlet temps
- **Near Zero (±1°C)**: Similar performance between systems
- **Negative (-2°C)**: Heat curve more efficient than ML predictions

### Energy Savings Percentage
- **0-5%**: Minimal savings potential
- **5-15%**: Moderate savings, worth considering
- **15%+**: High savings potential, strong active mode candidate

## Decision Making Guide

### When to Switch to Active Mode

**Ready for Active Mode** ✅
- Learning confidence > 7.0
- Efficiency advantage > 2°C consistently
- Stable parameter convergence for 2+ weeks
- Energy savings potential > 10%

**Continue Shadow Mode** ⚠️
- Learning confidence < 5.0

   ```yaml
   # In config.yaml
   SHADOW_MODE: false
   ```

2. **Restart service**:
   ```bash
   docker restart ml_heating
   ```

3. **Monitor transition**:
   - Check initial active mode performance

## FAQ

### Q: Will shadow mode affect my heating comfort?
**A:** No, shadow mode only learns in background. Your heat curve continues controlling heating normally.

### Q: How long should I run shadow mode?
**A:** Typically 2-4 weeks for basic competency, 1-2 months for high confidence. Depends on weather variety and heating cycles.

### Q: Can I switch back to shadow mode from active mode?
**A:** Yes, simply set `SHADOW_MODE: true` again. Previous learning is preserved.

### Q: What if ML shows worse efficiency than heat curve?
**A:** This indicates your heat curve is already well-optimized or ML needs more learning time. Continue shadow mode or optimize heat curve.

### Q: How much energy can I save?
**A:** Typical savings range from 5-20% depending on current heat curve efficiency and building characteristics.

### Q: Is shadow mode safe for my heating system?
**A:** Completely safe - shadow mode only observes and learns, never controls heating equipment.
