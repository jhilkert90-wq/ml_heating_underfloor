## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **ML Calibration Feature Pruning**: Automatic removal of features with permutation importance ≤ threshold (default 0.0), with retrain and MAE regression guard (≤ 0.5%). Configurable via `heating_ml_feature_pruning_enabled` and `heating_ml_prune_pi_threshold`.
- **LightGBM Regularisation**: Configurable L1/L2 regularisation (`heating_ml_reg_alpha`, `heating_ml_reg_lambda`) to reduce overfitting. Defaults: α=0.1, λ=1.0.
- **Optuna Hyper-Parameter Optimisation**: Optional Optuna-based HPO during ML calibration (`heating_ml_optuna_enabled`). Searches learning rate, depth, leaves, min_child_samples, and regularisation over configurable trial count.
- **Time-Series Cross-Validation**: Optional TimeSeriesSplit-based CV for more robust validation metrics (`heating_ml_cv_enabled`, `heating_ml_cv_n_splits`).
- **PV Trajectory Rescue Decoupling**: New `pv_traj_rescue_min_hours` config (default 1) decouples the forecast rescue threshold from `pv_traj_min_steps`. Fixes bug where gradual late-afternoon PV decline caused premature trajectory collapse and unwanted overshoot correction.
- **Holdout-Isolation Regression Test**: Added a dedicated unit test asserting Optuna/CV training fits do not consume temporal holdout rows.

### Fixed
- **Overshoot Correction Bug**: During PV trajectory rescue, the rescue condition was compared against `min_steps` (default 4), requiring 4 future forecast hours above PV threshold. A gradual PV decline (e.g. 1930W→1440W) with only 1 remaining hour above threshold caused rescue to fail, trajectory to collapse to min_steps, and overshoot correction to fire incorrectly with a −0.98°C blend. Now uses independent `rescue_min_hours` (default 1).
- **Calibration Holdout Leakage**: Optuna HPO and optional time-series CV now run on the fit split only, keeping the temporal holdout untouched for final validation metrics.
- **Calibration Edge-Case Robustness**: Optional CV now skips cleanly when the fit split is too short for `TimeSeriesSplit` instead of failing.
- **PV Heat Weight Bounds Mismatch**: Aligned `pv_heat_weight` lower bound to `0.0001` in thermal config bounds to match tests and add-on schema.

### Changed
- **Permutation Importance Execution**: Switched permutation importance to single-process execution (`n_jobs=1`) for better stability with mocked/non-picklable estimators in test and constrained runtime environments.
- **CV Tooltip Clarification**: Updated `heating_ml_cv_enabled` tooltip text in add-on config to match implementation (additional CV diagnostics plus dedicated temporal holdout, not replacement).
- **Unit Test Compatibility**: ML calibration fake regressors now use sklearn-compatible estimator mixins, removing deprecation-warning noise and future sklearn 1.8 breakage risk.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Gentle Trajectory Correction System**: Intelligent additive correction preventing outlet temperature spikes during thermal trajectory deviations

### Changed
- **MAJOR: Trajectory Correction Algorithm**: Replaced aggressive multiplicative correction (7x factors causing outlet spikes) with gentle additive approach based on user's heat curve automation (5°C/8°C/12°C per degree)
- **MAJOR: Thermal Model Simplification**: Removed differential-based effectiveness scaling to eliminate calibration-runtime mismatch and ensure consistent model behavior
- **Correction Boundaries**: Conservative ≤0.5°C/≤1.0°C/>1.0°C thresholds instead of aggressive ≤0.3°C/>0.5°C thresholds

### Fixed

- **Feature Storage During Binary Search** - Fixed missing forecast data access during trajectory verification phases
- **CRITICAL: Thermal Physics Model Bug** - Fixed fundamental physics implementation error causing physically impossible temperature predictions (heating systems predicting cooling)

- Cosmetic logging issue showing unrounded vs applied temperature values
- Test suite failures for outdoor coupling and thermal physics validation
