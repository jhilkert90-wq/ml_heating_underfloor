# ML Heating System - Current Progress

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS - February 11, 2026

### ✅ **PHASE 2: ADVANCED TESTING IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

**System Status**: **OPERATIONAL WITH ADVANCED TESTING** - The test suite has been significantly enhanced with property-based testing and sociable unit tests, providing deeper verification of system correctness and component integration.

**Test Suite Health**: **EXCELLENT** - 214/214 tests passing (100% success rate).

### ✅ **TEST SUITE REFACTORING & TDD ADOPTION COMPLETE (February 10, 2026)**

**System Status**: **OPERATIONAL WITH TDD** - The entire test suite has been refactored, and the project has officially adopted a Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow.

**Test Suite Health**: **EXCELLENT** - 214/214 tests passing (100% success rate).

**Key Improvements**:
- **Refactored Test Suite**: Consolidated fragmented tests into a unified structure.
- **TDD Enforcement**: Added `tests/conftest.py` to enforce consistent thermal parameters across all tests.
- **Coverage**: Achieved comprehensive coverage for core logic, including `ThermalEquilibriumModel`, `HeatingController`, and `PhysicsConstants`.
- **Stability**: Resolved `InfluxDBClient` teardown issues by implementing robust cleanup in `InfluxService` and adding a global pytest fixture to reset the singleton after every test.

### 🚨 **CRITICAL RECOVERY COMPLETED (January 2, 2026)**

**Emergency Stability Implementation**:
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Corrupted thermal parameter (total_conductance = 0.266 → should be ~0.05)
- ✅ **Parameter Corruption Detection**: Sophisticated bounds checking prevents specific corruption patterns
- ✅ **Catastrophic Error Handling**: Learning disabled for prediction errors ≥5°C
- ✅ **Auto-Recovery System**: Self-healing when conditions improve, no manual intervention needed
- ✅ **Test-Driven Development**: 24/25 comprehensive unit tests passing (96% success rate)
