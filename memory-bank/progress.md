# ML Heating System - Current Progress

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS - April 7, 2026

### ✅ **UNDERSHOOT GATE (mirror of overshoot gate)**

**System Status**: **OPERATIONAL** — Added undershoot projected-temperature gate to mirror the existing overshoot gate. When indoor temperature is rising naturally, undershoot corrections are skipped to let the house self-correct.

**Test Suite**: **495/504 passing** (9 pre-existing failures unrelated to changes)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Undershoot gate in `min_violates`-only branch
- ✅ Undershoot gate in `both_violated + min_wins` branch
- ✅ 6 new tests in `TestUndershootGate` class
- ✅ 8 existing tests adapted with explicit trend data for undershoot gate compatibility

**Files Modified**: `src/model_wrapper.py`, `tests/unit/test_trajectory_correction.py`, `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/progress.md`

## 🎯 PREVIOUS STATUS - April 4, 2026

### ✅ **SLAB MODEL FIXES & PV OSCILLATION DAMPING**

**System Status**: **OPERATIONAL WITH 6 TARGETED FIXES** — Production log analysis drove six precision fixes addressing HP-off outlet spike, PV oscillation, slab gate, and diagnostic improvements.

**Test Suite**: **397/402 passing** (5 pre-existing failures unrelated to changes)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ HP-off binary search: simulated HP-on delta_t prevents 35°C outlet spike
- ✅ Cloud discount on PV scalar: 1h forecast dampens sensor spikes in binary search
- ✅ PV routing: `max(current, smoothed)` captures solar thermal lag at sunset
- ✅ PV smoothing: window shortened from 3h to solar_decay_tau (~30min)
- ✅ Slab pump gate: `measured_delta_t >= 1.0` required for pump-ON branch
- ✅ Slab passive delta sensor: `inlet_temp - indoor_temp` exported to HA
- ✅ 3 env-dependent test fixes (ENABLE_MIXED_SOURCE_ATTRIBUTION monkeypatch)
- ✅ 10+ new tests added, 9 existing tests updated for compatibility
- ✅ Shadow mode + active mode verified (26/26 tests passing)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/model_wrapper.py` — HP-off fix, cloud discount, slab_passive_delta sensor
- `src/heat_source_channels.py` — PV routing max(current, smoothed)
- `src/temperature_control.py` — PV smoothing window
- `src/thermal_equilibrium_model.py` — Slab pump gate, _resolve_delta_t_floor

## Previous Status - March 31, 2026

### ✅ **HEAT SOURCE CHANNEL ARCHITECTURE (PHASE 2-4) IMPLEMENTED**

**System Status**: **OPERATIONAL WITH DECOMPOSED LEARNING** — Each heat source has its own independent learning channel with isolated parameters and prediction history. Phase 1 guards continue to protect the main control loop.

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ `src/heat_source_channels.py` — `HeatSourceChannel` ABC + 4 implementations + `HeatSourceChannelOrchestrator`
- ✅ `src/config.py` — `ENABLE_HEAT_SOURCE_CHANNELS` config variable (default: `true`)
- ✅ `.env_sample` — Documented with usage description
- ✅ Channel learning isolation: HP, PV, FP, TV learn from their own active periods only
- ✅ Proportional error attribution across active channels
- ✅ Solar transition forecasting via PV forecast array
- ✅ Per-channel state persistence (`get_channel_state()` / `load_channel_state()`)
- ✅ 8 new tests passing (test_heat_source_channels, test_solar_transition, test_learning_isolation)
- ⏳ Orchestrator integration into main control loop deferred (Phase 1 guards active)

### ✅ **PHASE 2: ADVANCED TESTING IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

**System Status**: **OPERATIONAL WITH ADVANCED TESTING** - The test suite has been significantly enhanced with property-based testing and sociable unit tests, providing deeper verification of system correctness and component integration.

**Test Suite Health**: **EXCELLENT** - 214/214 tests passing (100% success rate).

### ✅ **TEST SUITE REFACTORING & TDD ADOPTION COMPLETE (February 10, 2026)**

**Test Suite Health**: **EXCELLENT** - 214/214 tests passing (100% success rate).

**Key Improvements**:
- **Refactored Test Suite**: Consolidated fragmented tests into a unified structure.

### 🚨 **CRITICAL RECOVERY COMPLETED (January 2, 2026)**

**Emergency Stability Implementation**:
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: Corrupted thermal parameter (total_conductance = 0.266 → should be ~0.05)
